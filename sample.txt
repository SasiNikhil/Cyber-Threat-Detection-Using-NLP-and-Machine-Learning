Amazing content from @crookedmedia's @deray and @terrycrews ! BIG LOVE to men sharing openly moments of vulnerability, abuse, addiction, violence and emotion; what fantastic examples you both are.

My colleague (working on masters in Cyber security) thinks that you should pay the ransom should you be hit with ransomware. 
I said that is a terrible idea because in a majority of circumstances you will not get the private key and it gives incentive to bad actors to continue.
